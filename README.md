# phaser-tiled-extras
This plugin adds additional features from Tiled mapeditor to Phaser 2. It aims to integrate as seemless as possible with unmodified code. 
The plugin will not improve performance. For incresed performance I recommend the far more advanced plugin Phaser-Plugin https://github.com/englercj/phaser-tiled.

Planned features:
* Animated tiles
* Collisions defined in Tiled. (CollideUp etc.)

Maybes:
* Images? /imagelayer
* Objectgroup?
* Objects as triggers?
* More types of objects
* name to gid
