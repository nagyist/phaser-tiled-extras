# phaser-tiled-extras
This plugin adds additional features from Tiled mapeditor to Phaser 2. It aims to integrate as seemless as possible with unmodified code. 
The plugin will not improve performance. For incresed performance I recommend the far more advanced plugin Phaser-Tiled https://github.com/englercj/phaser-tiled.

Planned features:
* Animated tiles
* Triggers in Object layer
* Collisions defined in Tiled. (CollideUp etc.)

Maybes:
* Images? /imagelayer
* More types of objects
* name to gid
